The Wii U Memory Editor dz (a shortening of the projects predecessor DoomZoom) is a tool used to seamlessly interface with the Wii U over nothing but a TCP connection. This tool grants the ability to directly manipulate and monitor in-game memory ranges, allowing for real-time in-game modifications.

As previously stated, this project is a new version of my previous project DoomZoom. DoomZoom was originally a fork of a C# WinForms project of another users project. However, as I was expanding the project, the bottlenecks of working with low-level interactions with the Wii U in C# was quickly becoming annoying. This complete rewrite in C++ had two real purposes: porting over the features of DoomZoom designed for the game *The Wind Waker HD*, and creating an open framework for developers to utilize for other titles on the Wii U.

At the time of writing, dz currently allows the poke/peeking of memory addresses, as well as an inventory editor for *The Wind Waker HD*.

This project taught me quite a bit, particularly in the fields of TCP, HTTP, and wireshark. Debugging and working with tools such as [TCP Gecko](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/aRAMa) was a much different workflow than what I was used to in the past. The use of [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) in particular was something I did not have much experience in prior. Being able to visualize the packets being sent back and forth between the computer and the Wii U was a gamechanger when debugging issues.
