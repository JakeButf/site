## Introduction
Ghidra is a reverse-engineering tool that can be used to translate the assembly code within the exefs into more readable pseudocode.
This can be very useful to find and document the instructions and their offsets within the executable that we can hook into later.

<Aside>The [Breath of the Wild Decompilation Project](https://botw.link/) recommends the use of [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro) over Ghidra due to the more advanced features and the ability to use the decomp projects IDB. However, due to the very steep price tag of IDA Pro I do not use it and do not condone acquiring the software through illicit methods.</Aside>

## Installation
To begin you will want to download the latest version of [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) as well as the [Switch Loader](https://github.com/Adubbz/Ghidra-Switch-Loader).

## Decompiling
You can now import the previously acquired main.nso and run Ghidra's auto-analysis (this will take a while).

## Tools

I would suggest using my [botw-sym-helper](https://github.com/JakeButf/botw-sym-helper) python scripts as they make exporting symbols from Ghidra
easier while also providing some useful ways to format them. Since a large portion of the Switch RE community uses IDA 
we do not have all the handy tools for working with the symbols.

### Using the sym scripts
