The most useful functionality we get out of using Exlaunch is the ability to hook into the games functions and run our own
code.

## Trampoline Hook

Trampoline hooking is a method of injecting custom code into a pre-existing method. While Exlaunch does provide some macros
to accomplish this, I prefer to use a more direct method using function pointers.

Here's an example taken from [``inputs.cpp``](https://github.com/JakeButf/botw-exlaunch-base/blob/main/src/program/inputs.cpp):
The very first thing we need to do is store the function pointer of the function we are hooking into. In this example, we are using
an nn function that updates the state of the controller.

```cpp
using GetNpadStatesFunc = void(*)(nn::hid::NpadFullKeyState*, int, const unsigned int&);
static GetNpadStatesFunc GetNpadStatesImpl;
```

Now we want to create the function that will be called in place of ``nn::hid::NpadFullKeyState`` while also calling the original function:

```cpp
static void UpdateControllerStateHook(nn::hid::NpadFullKeyState* state, int port, const unsigned int& style) {
    GetNpadStatesImpl(state, port, style); //original function

    inputs::UpdateControllerState(); //our code to be run
}
```

Now we need to hook our new function in place of the old one:

<Aside>While we technically could not call the original function in our new function and instead set trampoline 
to true, this method could allow us to change arguments before they get to the original functions implementation.</Aside>

```cpp
void inputs::InitHooks()
{
    GetNpadStatesImpl = exl::hook::HookFunc<GetNpadStatesFunc>(
        &nn::hid::GetNpadStates, //function pointer to the original implementation
        UpdateControllerStateHook, //our new function
        false //run function as trampoline. since we call the original function in the new function we do not need this to be true
    );
}
```

Lastly, we want to make sure we are initializing the hooking environment and calling our ``inputs::InitHooks()`` in ``main.cpp``:

```cpp

extern "C" void exl_main(void* x0, void* x1) 
{
    // Setup hooking environment
    envSetOwnProcessHandle(exl::util::proc_handle::Get());
    exl::hook::Initialize();

    //Init Hooks
    inputs::InitHooks();
}
```

## Replace Hook

While trampoline hooks keep the original implementation of function, replace hooks completely replace the functionality.

Going back to our inputs example, we can avoid calling the original implementation in our hooking function like so:

```cpp
static void UpdateControllerStateHook(nn::hid::NpadFullKeyState* state, int port, const unsigned int& style) 
{
    inputs::UpdateControllerState(); //only our code is in the hooking function
}
```

We also want to make sure we are setting trampoline to false:

```cpp
void inputs::InitHooks()
{
    GetNpadStatesImpl = exl::hook::HookFunc<GetNpadStatesFunc>(
        &nn::hid::GetNpadStates, //function pointer to the original implementation
        UpdateControllerStateHook, //our new function
        false //trampoline is false
    );
}
```

Just like before we need to initialize the hooking environment and initialize our hooks:


Lastly, we want to make sure we are initializing the hooking environment and calling our ``inputs::InitHooks()`` in ``main.cpp``:

```cpp

extern "C" void exl_main(void* x0, void* x1) 
{
    // Setup hooking enviroment
    envSetOwnProcessHandle(exl::util::proc_handle::Get());
    exl::hook::Initialize();

    //Init Hooks
    inputs::InitHooks();
}
```
