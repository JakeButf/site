### Client-Server Architecture

AWS' service for client-server architecture is known as the *EC2*. An EC2 instance is a virtual server at Amazon that handles requests from clients.

The client makes a request to the EC2, the EC2 checks it's validity, then it delivers the response.

## Pay For What You Use

One of the biggest strengths of using AWS is their "pay only for what you use" approach to monetization. For this reason, AWS is extremely cost-efficient as you do not have to pay for unused resources. This is different from traditional on-premise data centers, which require you to invest in capacity *upfront*, regardless of demand or how much you actually need. With AWS, you scale resources dynamically and only pay for what you use.

### Why This Matters

AWS is designed to make cloud infastructure cost-effective, flexible, and scalable for businesses and even individuals. This approach gives you the room to optimize your infastructure, support modern application needs, and embrace cloud with confidence.
