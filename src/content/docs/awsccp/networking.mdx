## Connectivity to AWS
### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

Amazon VPC is a networking service that enables you to provision an **isolated section** of the AWS Cloud. Within a VPC, you can:

- Define a virtual network to launch your AWS resources
- Organize resources into subnets (smaller segments within the VPC)

VPCs provide network boundaries that restrict and control traffic flow between AWS customers and services.

### Internet Gateway

- Connects your VPC to the **public internet**
- Enables public traffic to access resources like Amazon EC2 instances
- Similar to a doorway that lets customers enter a coffee shop
- Required for any resources within your VPC that need internet access

### Virtual Private Gateway

- Allows encrypted traffic to enter the VPC via a VPN connection
- Used to connect a VPC to a private network (like an on-premises data center)
- Adds a layer of protection while using public internet routes
- Accepts traffic only from approved networks

### AWS Direct Connect

- Establishes a dedicated private connection between your data center and AWS
- Avoids the public internet entirely
- Provides lower latency and higher security
- Comparable to a private hallway that links your building directly to the coffee shop (AWS), bypassing public roads

## Subnets and Network Access Control Lists

### Subnets

- A subnet is a section of a VPC where resources can be grouped based on security or operational needs.
- Public subnets: Contain resources accessible to the internet.
- Private subnets: Contain resources not directly accessible from the internet.
- Subnets within a VPC can communicate with each other.

### Network Traffic in a VPC

- Incoming traffic enters a VPC through an internet gateway.
- Traffic is evaluated before entering or leaving a subnet using network access control lists (ACLs).
- After entering a subnet, traffic to individual resources (like EC2 instances) is evaluated by security groups.

### Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- ACLs are virtual firewalls that operate at the subnet level.
- Control inbound and outbound traffic using a set of rules.
- Stateless: ACLs do not remember previous requests and evaluate each packet independently.
- Default ACL: Allows all traffic unless modified.
- Custom ACL: Denies all traffic by default until rules are added.
- All ACLs have an explicit deny rule for unmatched packets.

### Security Groups

- A security group is a virtual firewall at the instance level.
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic to the instance.
- Stateful: Remembers previous connections and automatically allows return traffic.
- Default behavior:
  - Deny all inbound traffic
  - Allow all outbound traffic
- You can associate:
  - One security group with multiple instances
  - Different security groups per instance

#### Analogy:
A security group is like a door attendant at an apartment building who checks incoming guests but doesnâ€™t recheck guests leaving.

### Key Differences

| Feature             | Network ACLs                 | Security Groups             |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Level               | Subnet                       | Instance                    |
| Type                | Stateless                    | Stateful                    |
| Default Rules       | Allow all (default ACL)      | Deny all inbound, allow outbound |
| Traffic Direction   | Must explicitly allow both directions | Automatically allows return traffic |
| Use Case            | Broad network boundary control | Fine-grained instance-level control |

## Domain Name System (DNS) and Amazon Route 53

### Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS is the system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses so users can access websites.

- DNS is like the phone book of the internet.
- When a user enters a domain (ex: AnyCompany.com), the request is sent to a DNS server.
- The DNS server returns the IP address of the web server (ex: 192.0.2.0) that hosts the website.
- The user's browser then connects to that IP address to load the website.

### Amazon Route 53

Amazon Route 53 is AWS's scalable and highly available DNS web service.

Key features:
- Routes user requests to AWS services (EC2, load balancers) or resources hosted outside AWS.
- Registers domain names and manages DNS records.
- Allows transfers of DNS records from other registrars for centralized domain management.

### How Route 53 and CloudFront Work Together

Example: A customer accesses AnyCompany.com.

1. The customer enters AnyCompany.com in their browser.
2. Amazon Route 53 performs DNS resolution and returns the IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.0).
3. The request is sent to the nearest edge location using Amazon CloudFront.
4. CloudFront forwards the request to an Application Load Balancer.
5. The load balancer routes the request to an appropriate Amazon EC2 instance in the Auto Scaling group.

This setup ensures low latency, high availability, and scalable content delivery for users around the world.
