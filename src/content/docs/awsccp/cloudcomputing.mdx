## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.

### On-demand Delivery

One huge benefit of AWS is the on-demand delivery service. When using AWS services you do not need to request resources in advance, you just use the storage when you need it. If suddenly you are in need of 300 virtual servers, you can just go and launch them. If you need 10,000 terabytes of storage, you can just start using it whenever you need it. This is a huge benefit for scaling your resources, you can do it anytime at any speed you need.

Here's a practical example:

Let's say that you need a cloud developer environment for 50 different developers. These developers do not work 24 hours a day, and they also probably don't work 7 hours a week, so why would you pay for those environments during those times? You can spin up environments and resources whenever you need, and you are only charged when they're actually being used.

## Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

When choosing a cloud strategy, businesses must consider factors like:

- Required application components
- Preferred resource management tools
- Legacy IT infrastructure needs

### The Three Cloud Deployment Models

#### Cloud-Based Deployment
- All parts of the application run in the cloud.
- Ideal for migrating existing applications or building new ones in the cloud.
- Can use low-level infrastructure (more IT management) or higher-level services (less management).

Example: An app using cloud-based virtual servers, databases, and networking.

#### On-Premises Deployment
- Resources are hosted and managed on-site.
- Uses virtualization and application/resource management tools to optimize usage.

Example: Applications running entirely within a companyâ€™s data center.

#### Hybrid Deployment
- Combines cloud-based resources with on-premises infrastructure.
- Useful for integrating with legacy apps or meeting compliance requirements.

Example: Legacy apps stay on-premises while cloud services handle data analytics and batch processing.

Each model offers unique benefits depending on a company's operational needs, compliance considerations, and technical capabilities.

## Why Choose Cloud Computing?
When addressing business needs, companies often choose cloud computing for the following reasons:

### Trade Upfront Expense for Variable Expense
- Traditional IT requires large upfront investments in data centers and hardware.
- Cloud computing replaces this with variable expense, where you only pay for what you use.
- Enables cost-effective innovation and experimentation.

### Stop Spending Money on Data Centers
- Managing on-premises infrastructure takes time and money.
- Cloud computing allows companies to shift focus from server maintenance to delivering value through apps and services.

### Stop Guessing Capacity
- No need to predict infrastructure needs in advance.
- Easily scale resources up or down (e.g., with EC2) based on demand.
- Pay only for the compute power you actually use.

### Benefit from Economies of Scale
- Cloud providers like AWS serve hundreds of thousands of customers.
- This large-scale usage results in lower variable costs and more affordable pricing.

### Increase Speed and Agility
- Quickly develop, test, and deploy applications.
- Access infrastructure resources in minutes, not weeks, compared to traditional data centers.
- Encourages faster innovation cycles.

### Go Global in Minutes
- AWS has a global infrastructure, enabling rapid worldwide deployment.
- Applications can reach global customers with low latency regardless of location.
