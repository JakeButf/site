## Problem

```js
class Solution {
	/**
	 * @param {string} s
	 * @param {string} t
	 * @return {boolean}
	 */
	isAnagram(s, t) {
		let sArr = s.split('');
		let tArr = t.split('');

		sArr.sort();
		tArr.sort();

		let resS = sArr.toString();
		let resT = tArr.toString();

		return resS === resT;
	}
}
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

### Thoughts/Notes
This is a very simple problem. It's also very easy to accomplish in O(n) time by: coverting the strings to arrays, sorting them, then check if they are the same.
