#### Easy Difficulty

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

## First Solution

```js
class Solution {
	/**
	 * @param {number[]} nums
	 * @return {boolean}
	 */
	hasDuplicate(nums) {
		let seen = [];
		let dupe = false;
		nums.forEach((num) => {
			if (seen.includes(num)) {
				dupe = true;
			}
			seen.push(num);
		})
		return dupe;
	}
}
```
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

### Thoughts/Notes

This was a very easy problem to solve, just keep track of elements you've seen and then check if any of them are already seen. However, since I used .includes, this is time complexity O(n^2). However an O(n) solution is super easy.

## Second Solution

```js
class Solution {
	/**
	 * @param {number[]} nums
	 * @return {boolean}
	 */
	hasDuplicate(nums) {
		let sorted = nums;
		sorted.sort();

		for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
			if (sorted[i] === sorted[i - 1]) return true;
		}

		return false;
	}
}
```

### Thoughts/Notes

Almost an easier solution to the original. The crux is just sorting the array and then checking if there's an identical element next to it.
