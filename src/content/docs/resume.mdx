## Personal Info

### Jacob Butfiloski
#### Software Engineer

My name is Jacob Butfiloski, I am a detail-oriented Information Science professional with a
focus on web development based in Tampa, Florida. While I graduate with a degree in
Information Science in spring, I’ve worked professionally through hands-on roles in software
development, web development, and education.

Currently, I serve as a front-end Engineer for the YMCA of West Central Florida, where I design,
develop, and maintain a website as well as web applications that helps create community
engagement and brings the company closer to the standards of the modern digital age. By collaborating with different members of
the team, I help create solutions that align with the YMCA’s mission to bring outdated systems
into the digital sphere. These abilities were in part shaped through my coursework in classes
such as Principles of Information Security, Networks & Communication, and WWW Page
Design/Management.

In addition to my role at the YMCA, I work as a Programming Instructor at CodeFu, teaching
coding fundamentals to elementary school students. Here, I help create curriculum and teach
lessons that introduce young learners to logic-building, problem-solving, and foundational
programming concepts through platforms like Scratch, Scratch Jr, Bloxels, and 
Python. This role allows me to take something I am very passionate about and share it with the
next generation of STEM students.

My technical proficiency includes the programming languages of C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript,
HTML5, and CSS. JavaScript frameworks such as React, React-Native, AstroJS, and ElectronJS. I
hold the Microsoft MTA: Software Development Fundamentals certification, which was
acquired through my foundational understanding of software lifecycle management, algorithmic
thinking, and debugging principles. Academic coursework, including Object-Oriented
Programming (Java SE), WWW Page Design/Management, and Information Policy & Ethics,
has further helped me to balance strong technicality with ethical considerations, such as data
privacy and inclusive design.

Beyond my professional work, I have had a long-time curiosity and passion towards Software
Development backed by an extensive amount of individual projects I have pursued to expand
my knowledge outside of the realm of education. My fascination with low-level programming
(C/C++) and graphics programming has led me to experiment with rendering engines, shader
development, as well as reverse-engineering projects. One of my most rewarding endeavors
involves reverse engineering the Nintendo Wii U console where I develop custom software that
is able to interface with the console’s memory across a TCP connection. These projects not only
deepened my understanding of system architecture but also helped push my passion for
pushing technical boundaries.

I thrive in environments that value innovation, continuous learning, and interdisciplinary
collaboration.
