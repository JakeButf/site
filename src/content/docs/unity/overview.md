description: Overview of my Unity notes.

I've been using Unity for years at this point (since 2017), however, as my overall knowledge has improved, so has my coding practices within the engine. These docs will cover things that I have learned for later reference for both myself and others it may benefit.

As of now, I am currently using Unity 2021.3.6f1. This was the latest stable release when I began on my main project (Project Solstice) and will remain on this release for the foreseeable future due to modern Unity TOS changes.
